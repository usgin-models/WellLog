This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for Well Log observations. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

For the workbook, each line is for one log, and each well may have a variety of scanned log files (LAS, TIF, XLS, PDF). These files are meant to be listed as separate records.
This workbook describes a content model for well log observation features. These will be point features that locate the well origin for a well bore from which a well log is available. The well log observation record describes the log (type, top and bottom of logged interval) and provides links to representations of the actual log data, which typically will be either a paper copy, scanned image, or LAS file. In some cases the log may be represented in an Excel Spreadsheet. The content model includes basic information describing the well and well bore from which the log was obtained for use in search and filtering to discover logs of interest. Each row in the WellLogObservationContent sheet in this workbook will correspond to an individual log from a borehole; thus there may be multiple rows per well. For logs that are scanned or digitized andavailableas online resources, Scanned File URLs will be provided. The WellBoreURI for the loggedwell boreis the cross-referencing link (foreign key) used to associate the header record, well log records, temperature measurements, and other information from a particular borehole.
